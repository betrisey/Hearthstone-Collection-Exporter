# Hearthstone-Collection-Exporter
This program written in AHK script will search every card and export all the ones you have and the number of each.
So i have finally made my hearthstone collection exporter.

It is the ugliest piece of software you have probably ever seen, I have only tested it on the English language and its far from finished.

However with all that said here it is: https://mega.co.nz/#!mJcHiSZJ!MJsI_uUtUsEID5napqD4xItpIbPICdcVN7iIXAT3tLg

Instructions are as follows:

* Open the the EXE file and follow the instructions on screen.
* Calibrate it using the calibrate button on the set selection menu whenever you change your game resolution window size or post processing effects.
* The output will be a text file that it will ask you to save somewhere.
* You can select which sets to export as normally afte the 1st export only classic(expert) and GVG will need to be exported again.
* The export can be directly pasted into the below collection google sheet on the "Collection Data" sheet tab and it will show your collection in all of its glory and give you real time stats on where you are at.

Ok now onto the bad parts:
* It will not recognize more than 2 of each card (2 normals + 2 golden max)
* It is best run with hearthstone in full screen at the highest resolution you can manage but should work at any res theoretically.
* It maye have many bugs as this is still an alpha version.
* The GUI is diabolical at best as it was built as a test GUI for me.
* The exporter is a tad unreliable on slower systems i will add an option to make it more reliable for lower end systems in the future.
* probably a plethora of other shit things.


Ok so that's it hope you enjoy and any problems post them here. Can't guarantee I'll fix them any time soon or i might as this is just more a proof it can be done than anything.
